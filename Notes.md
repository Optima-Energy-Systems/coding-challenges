Implementation Notes
====================

The projects have been developed in visual studio 2017 community edition. The following folders have been added:

* RobotWars -  holds the robot wars solution.
* SupermarketKata - holds the supermarked kata solution.


Both projects are c# and were developed in a pure TDD style where the design emerged as I was implementing the tests.  The guard statments that were put in are not covered by tests that is purely from habit where I tend to cover the happy and sad paths with tests but not the defensive programming constructs.  I tried to stick to the 2 hr time slots but probably slightly exceeded it on both projects I checked in at aout the two hour mark.
